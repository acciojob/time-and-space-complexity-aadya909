    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of its input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is more efficient and performs faster for large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It includes both the space needed for input storage and any additional space used during execution. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) grows linearly with the input size.</p>
